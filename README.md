# Network-Traffic-Analyzer
An IDS for various internet protocols
Step 1: Set Up Development Environment
1.1 Choose a programming language for the core functionality, such as C for network capturing, Python for machine learning, and possibly Streamlit for the GUI.

1.2 Install necessary development tools, libraries, and frameworks for C and Python.

Step 2: Network Capturing with C
2.1 Use C to capture network traffic using system calls or APIs. Libraries like libpcap or WinPcap can be helpful.

2.2 Implement a module for users to select and analyze specific protocols. Allow users to define custom protocols.

Step 3: Traffic Generation with Ostinato
3.1 Integrate Ostinato for generating network traffic with protocols like TCP, HTTP, ICMP, UDP, etc.

3.2 Develop a user-friendly interface to configure traffic generation parameters.

Step 4: Machine Learning in Python
4.1 Choose a machine learning library like scikit-learn or TensorFlow for Python.

4.2 Implement machine learning models to analyze network traffic in real-time. Train models to classify normal and potentially malicious requests.

4.3 Integrate the machine learning models into the C application for real-time analysis.

Step 5: GUI Development with Streamlit
5.1 Create a Streamlit application for the user interface.

5.2 Design interactive and customizable visualizations using Streamlit components.

5.3 Implement features to explore and analyze historical network activity with charts and graphs.

Step 6: User Authentication and Authorization
6.1 Implement user authentication using libraries like Flask-Login for Python.

6.2 Define user roles and permissions to control access to specific features and data.

Step 7: Alerting Mechanism
7.1 Implement a robust alerting mechanism within the C application to notify users or administrators of security threats.

7.2 Develop features to customize alert settings and notifications.

Step 8: Testing and Debugging
8.1 Conduct thorough testing of individual modules and the integrated system.

8.2 Debug and fix any issues or errors that arise during testing.

Step 9: Documentation
9.1 Create comprehensive documentation for users and developers.

9.2 Include guides on installation, configuration, and using the software.

Step 10: Deployment
10.1 Package the software for easy deployment on target systems.

10.2 Distribute the software and provide ongoing support and updates
